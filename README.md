## What was on our mind?
|Research Subject|Examples|Impacts|Description|Difficulties|Author|Final Choice|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Games that teach you how to code|1.Human Resource Machine 2.Code combat|Visionary programming makes learning programming more vivid and less abstract|Game that is based on visionary programming We prefer make it follows OOP like Java|1.How do we return the result from pseudo-code? 2.GUI heavy level design|Sai Cao|No|
|MIPS Educational Game|Just like code factory, but specific case for MIPS architecture|Help people learning CSE341 from their web browsers|Web based MIPS game|1. Understanding MIPS 2. Learning both HTML5 and JS 3. We might also have to make it compatible to Firefox and Edge prior to April 2019 Update|Dr. Winikus, Dr. Hartloff, and Sai Cao|Yes|
|Chemistry review game|None|Review chemistry equations and labs|Understanding materials better such as using more vivid colours|None|Xiang Li|No|
|Merlin addon for ASUS RT-AC86U|AIDA64 on all its supported platforms|None|We are creating one-stop shop for analyzing usages for Users of ASUS RT-AC86U|1. Since this is embedded system, it means we have to optimize codes as much as we can 2. Too specific|Hanzhang Bai|No|
|Emacs addon|mips-mode, helm-mode, emms-mode|Helps programmer to increase their efficiency by making Emacs into a one-stop shop so they do not need to switch apps|Emacs are way more powerful than you will believe|Understanding Emacs and also Elisp programming language|Tianyu Cao|No|
