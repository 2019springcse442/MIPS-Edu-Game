# Unit Test Scripts
Under development since I need to understand these documentation

# Mocha Unit Test Documentation

I suggest you run a system check before start debugging this project. I will update these scripts when dependencies changes.

### Install on Windows

* In progress

### Install on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
Use the installation script and run with `sudo ./install.sh` unless you are root

If you are root, run with `./install.sh` instead
